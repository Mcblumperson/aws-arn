* Releasing

** Release Repository

Clojars

** Snapshots

Branching will build and create a new release artifact as branchname-SNAPSHOT

** Releases

Candidate releases should exist on a new branch with an open pull request into master.

If:
- the PR merge build is successful
- any release testing is successful
Then a new release may be created.

Create a release by tagging the PR commit. This is easily done in the
Github UI, The tag action will trigger a new build. This build will
create an artifact based on the tag version.

For example: tagging 0.1.0 on the head of feature/foo will produce a
new artifact in Clojars as awn-arn 0.1.0.

When released, merge the pull request into master ready for subsequent
development work.
